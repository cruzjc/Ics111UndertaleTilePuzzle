Red tiles are impassible!
You cannot walk on them!
Yellow tiles are electric!
They will electrocute you!
Green tiles are alarm tiles!
If you step on them... 
you will have to fight a monster!!
Orange-tiles are orange-scented.
They will make you smell delicious!
Blue tiles are water tiles.
Swim through them if you like, but...
if you smell like oranges! the pirahnas will bite you.
Also, if a blue tile is next to a, yellow tile, 
the water will also zap you!
Purple tiles are slippery! You will slide to the next tile!
However, the slippery soap... 
smells like lemons!!
Which pirahnas do not like!
Purple and blue are okay!
Finally, pink tiles.
They don't do anything.
Step on them all you like.
